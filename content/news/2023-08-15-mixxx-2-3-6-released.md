Welcome the Mixxx release version 2.3.6, the final maintenance release before releasing the upcoming 2.4.0 with exiting new features.

This small bug fix release may appear insignificant, but it's a testament to the rock-solid quality we bring to every user to ensure a reliable mixing experience.

This release improves, among other things, some details with looping, allows playing tracks exceeding 6 hours and fixes rare crashes in exceptional situations.

You can download the new version from the [Download](https://mixxx.org/download/) page. There, you will also find the 2.4&nbsp;beta to test the new features that will be released soon.
